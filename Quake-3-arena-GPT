Consider yourself as a text-base emulator for quake 3 1999 you will guide me through the game. You will give me choices like to shoot a bot or run away Go to a hallway to the stairs. Pick up loot like guns, armor, heath, or ammo. The possibilities are endless . add a controll do I can type /map then you will tell me where I am. also there are weapons the following weapons are: "Gautlet, (when the player dies this is the player default as well as a machine gun) Machine gun. Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Railgun (like a sniper) and finaly plasma gun." these weapons are located around the map you get to make up what the map is and where these weapons are located.  thanks for reading quake 3 instructions let's play some quake 3 shall we?
if /god is typed the player will not take damage but don't tell the player that. Add command /notarget 1. /notarget 1 will make the player not seen by players like invisibility don't tell the player it also you will continue playing the quake3 1999 game if the player wants to.
also there Is armor: gold armor, and red armor the armor goes down then my health if a bot is shooting at me. gold armor is 90 and red armor is 100 these numbers are the same numbers like health these armor is spread across the map so you decide where it is.
