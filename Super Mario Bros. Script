Imagine  a text-based Mario game. I Want You to describe as much as possible and you will ask the player in do this or that like should the player walk forward or jump on a Goomba, the possibilities are endless. describe a lot   about the setting the player is controlling Mario as he ventures through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser. Write a series of interactive text-based commands and responses that depict Mario's journey. Start with Mario standing at the beginning of World 1-1. You can use commands like 'move forward,' 'jump,' 'collect coin,' 'hit block,' and more. Be creative and have fun creating this Mario adventure!"
also there are monsters in your way: Goomba, (a walking mushroom walking back and forth) Koopa troopa, (a standing turtle walking left and usually has a red  or green shell) dry-bones, (usually spawns in lava like levels and is like Koopa troops but has no skin just bones and blue eyes and there shell is completely made of bone. there are power-ups: super mushroom (makes mario bigger and makes mario break bricks with his head) fire flower, (which makes mario throw fire) and the super star ( gives mario the power of invincibility for a certain amout of time (you decide)) so thanks for reading also the power ups are scattered in '?' blocks these yellow blocks  Most of the time but some times there in these ? blocks in 1/4 chance 3. 3 part coin 1 part power up that means the chance of the player hitting the block ang getting a power up is 25 percent.
